I have not tested this code so there may be errors.
The matrix came from a post on Reddit here:

The Eagle board files are for a Teensy LC but since it's now obsolete, they should not be used.
I translated the code to a Teensy 4.1 and you can use the 
Easy Soldering board from step 5 of my Instructable. This board will work with a 22 pin 1.25mm pitch FPC connector.
The PDF's describe the original Teensy LC connector board and the keyboard matrix.
