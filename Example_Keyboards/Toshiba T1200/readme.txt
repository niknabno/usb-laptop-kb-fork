I have not tested this code so there may be errors.
The matrix came from a post on Reddit here:

The original board used a Teensy LC but since it's now obsolete, I translated the code to a Teensy 4.1
Use the Easy Soldering board from step 5 of my Instructable with a Teensy 4.1 and a 22 pin 1.25mm pitch FPC connector.
The PDF's describe the original Teensy LC connector board and the keyboard matrix.
