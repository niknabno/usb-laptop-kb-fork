Thinkpad T61 USB or Bluetooth Keyboard Controller using a Raspberry Pi Pico W 

**************This project is still in development*************************. 
The keyboard was tested with KMK and all keys are working (see KMK folder). 
The TrackPoint was tested with Arduino C code and is also working (see Arduino folder).
Code to combine the keyboard and TrackPoint has not yet been developed.

The circuit board file "Pico_T61_Keyboard" will work with all T60 series keyboards.
A different circuit board file named "Pico_T420_Keyboard" is used for all T400 series and X200 series keyboards.

See the PDF for all the design information.
