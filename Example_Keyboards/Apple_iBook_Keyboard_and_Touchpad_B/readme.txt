These Eagle layouts are for an obsolete Teensy 3.2 cutout board so should not be used for new builds. 
The Teensy 3.2 code is for a G3 Clamshell keyboard and a Dell PS/2 touchpad (not the original clamshell touchpad).
For new builds that use the Teensy 4.0, go to the iBookG3_Clamshell folder for board layouts and keyboard code given here.
