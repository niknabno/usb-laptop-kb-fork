# This program is used to decode the key matrix of a laptop keyboard. Use an FPC connector to connect all the 
# laptop keyboard pins to the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi Pico. The program cycles thru all the possible pin 
# combinations looking for a connection when a key is pressed. Open an editor with a text file that lists all 
# the keyboard keys. The program will send over USB, the two GPIO pin numbers that are connected when a key is pressed.
# Once all keys have been tested, the editor will contain a complete listing of the keyboard connections.
